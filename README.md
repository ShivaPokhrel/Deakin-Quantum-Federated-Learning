### Our Ongoing Projects

#### 1. Improving Federated Aggregation with Deep Unfolding Networks
The performance of Federated learning (FL) is negatively affected by device differences and statistical
characteristics between participating clients. To address this issue, we introduce a deep unfolding network (DUN)-
a based technique that learns adaptive weights that unbiasedly ameliorate the adverse impacts of heterogeneity. The
proposed method demonstrates impressive accuracy and quality-aware aggregation. Furthermore, it evaluated the best-
weighted normalization approach to define less computational power on the aggregation method. The numerical
experiments in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and provide insights into the
interpretability of the unbiased weights learned. By incorporating unbiased weights into the model, the proposed
approach effectively addresses quality-aware aggregation under the heterogeneity of the participating clients and the FL environment.

#### 2. SECURE COMMUNICATION MODEL FOR QFL
 We design a model of Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Quantum Federated
Learning (QFL). We develop a proof of concept with a dynamic server selection
and study convergence and security conditions. We develop a preliminary study
with a proof of concept model of post-quantum secure QFL.

#### 3. Performance Analysis and Evaluation of Post Quantum Secure Blockchained Federated Learning
 We develop a hybrid approach to employ PQC over blockchain-based FL (BFL), where we combine a stateless signature scheme like Dilithium (or Falcon) with a stateful hash-based signature scheme like the extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). We propose a linear-based formulaic approach to device role selection mechanisms based on multiple factors to address performance. Our holistic approach of utilizing a verifiable random function (VRF) to assist in the blockchain consensus mechanism shows the practicality of the proposed approaches. The proposed method and extensive experimental results enhance the security and performance aspects of BFL systems.

#### 4. Decentralized QFL for Metaverse: Analysis, Design and Implementation
We develop a decentralized and trustworthy quantum federated learning (QFL) framework. The proposed QFL leverages the power of blockchain to create a secure and transparent system that is robust against cyberattacks and fraud. In addition, the decentralized QFL system addresses the risks associated with a centralized server-based approach. With extensive experiments and analysis, we evaluate classical federated learning (CFL) and QFL in a distributed setting and demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the proposed design.

#### 5. QFL: Analysis, Design, and Implementation
We provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of QFL, addressing a crucial knowledge gap in the existing literature. We develop ideas for new QFL frameworks, explore diverse use cases of applications, and consider the critical factors influencing their design. The technical contributions and limitations of various QFL research projects are examined while presenting future research directions and open questions for further exploration.

#### 7 Post Quantum Secure Blockchained Federated Learning
We employ Federated Learning (FL) and prominent features of blockchain in MEC architecture, such
as connected autonomous vehicles to simultaneously enable complete decentralization, immutability, and rewarding mechanisms.
FL is advantageous for mobile devices with constrained connectivity since it requires model updates to be delivered to a central
point instead of substantial data communication. For instance, FL in autonomous, connected vehicles can increase data
diversity and allow model customization, and predictions are possible even when the cars are not connected (by exploiting their local models) for short times. However, existing synchronous FL and Blockchain incur extremely high communication costs
due to mobility-induced impairments and do not apply directly to MEC networks. We propose a fully asynchronous Blockchained
The Federated Learning (BFL) framework, referred to as BFL-MEC, is where the mobile clients and their models evolve independently yet guarantee stability in the global learning process. More importantly, we employ post-quantum secure features over BFL-MEC to verify the clientâ€™s identity and defend against malicious attacks.

#### 8. Deep Unfolding QFL
We implement quantum variational circuits on classification problems to define the best approach to quantum federated aggregation using qiskit framework and extend the previously proposed deep unfolding framework in classical federated learning settings to design a quantum-based deep unfolding structure to enhance the quantum aggregation process. Also, we would like to evaluate the proposed architecture with bench-mark datasets and offer future enhancements.
