### Our Ongoing Projects

#### 1. Improving Federated Aggregation with Deep Unfolding Networks
> Federated learning (FL) performance is negatively affected by device differences and statistical
> characteristics between participating clients. To address this issue, we introduce a deep unfolding network (DUN)-
> based technique that learns adaptive weights that unbiasedly ameliorate the adverse impacts of heterogeneity. The
> proposed method demonstrates impressive accuracy and quality-aware aggregation. Furthermore, it evaluated the best-
> weighted normalization approach to define less computational power on the aggregation method. The numerical
> experiments carried out in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and provide insights into the
interpretability of the unbiased weights learned. By incorporating unbiased weights into the model, the proposed
> approach effectively addresses quality-aware aggregation under heterogeneity of the participating clients and the FL environment.

#### 2. SECURE COMMUNICATION MODEL FOR QFL
> We design a model of Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Quantum Federated
Learning (QFL). We develop a proof of concept with a dynamic server selection
and study convergence and security conditions. We develop a preliminary study
with a proof of concept model of post-quantum secure QFL.

#### 3. Performance Analysis and Evaluation of Post Quantum Secure Blockchained Federated Learning
> n this work, we propose a hybrid approach to employ PQC over blockchain-based FL (BFL), where we combine a stateless signature scheme like Dilithium (or Falcon) with a stateful hash-based signature scheme like the extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). We propose a linear-based formulaic approach to device role selection mechanisms based on multiple factors to address the performance aspect. Our holistic approach of utilizing a verifiable random function (VRF) to assist in the blockchain consensus mechanism shows the practicality of the proposed approaches. The proposed method and extensive experimental results contribute to enhancing the security and performance aspects of BFL systems.

#### 4. Decentralized QFL for Metaverse: Analysis, Design and Implementation
> To this end, we develop a decentralized and trustworthy quantum federated learning (QFL) framework. The proposed QFL leverages the power of blockchain to create a secure and transparent system that is robust against cyberattacks and fraud. In addition, the decentralized QFL system addresses the risks associated with a centralized server-based approach. With extensive experiments and analysis, we evaluate classical federated learning (CFL) and QFL in a distributed setting and demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the proposed design.

#### 4. QFL: Analysis, Design and Implementation
> This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of QFL, addressing a crucial knowledge gap in the existing literature. We develop ideas for new QFL frameworks, explore diverse use cases of applications, and consider the critical factors influencing their design. The technical contributions and limitations of various QFL research projects are examined while presenting future research directions and open questions for further exploration.
